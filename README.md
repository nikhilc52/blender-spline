# Overview

In this handbook, we'll be going over how to make a camera follow a spline's movement in Blender. This process includes four main steps:

1. Adding a spline
2. Editing the spline
3. Setting up the camera path and tracking
4. Editing the camera's path and tracking

To accomplish these four steps, we can use two different, yet intertwined approaches, one exclusively in Blender, and the other using Python for automation.

The first approach in Blender will manually go through each of the four steps. The second, in Python, will automate steps one and three (generating a spline from a csv of points), but still have the option to complete steps two and four in Blender if needed.
